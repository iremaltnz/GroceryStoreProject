# Database 2 Lessons Homework 

Homework Requirements
- An MVC .Net based web project will be designed for use by grocery stores.
In the designed project, the personnel working in the grocery store will use the system.
- A page should be designed in the application where the products can be entered. In addition, the pages where the category information, brand information and stock information of these products can be entered by the user should also be designed separately. Product, Brand, Category and Stock tables must be filled through these pages.
- A page should be designed where user information can be entered. User and Role tables should be filled with the information of the users working in the grocery store.
- A login page should be designed where users can log into the system.
- Pages should be designed where relevant data can be entered for each sales transaction in the grocery store. The Sales and SalesItems tables must be filled.
- All changes that occur in the database as a result of the operations performed on the pages should be recorded in the log tables with triggers (add, delete and update operations).
- All database operations (add, delete, update, etc.) performed within the project should be performed using only procedures and functions. There should be absolutely no queries in the project.
